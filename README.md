# If-Else-If Condition in C  

This repository contains a C program demonstrating the **if-else-if** conditional statement. The **if-else-if** ladder is used when multiple conditions need to be checked sequentially.  
  

## Program Overview  
- The program takes user input.  
- It evaluates conditions using the **if-else-if** statement.  
- It prints different outputs based on the given conditions.  


## How to Run

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Fatima-progmmer/If-else-if-condition-in-C.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:  
   ```sh
   cd If-else-if-condition-in-C
   ```
3. Compile the program:  
   ```sh
   gcc program.c -o program
   ```
4. Run the executable:  
   ```sh
   ./program
   ```
